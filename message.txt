# Hey babyy,

happy (belated) anniversary baby i know i gave this super late for you but i didnt want to give it to you when i havent perfected what i truly want to say to you and i want to make sure no stone is unturned i want to be clear of how much i love you and how much you mean to me amor. if i could be honest with you i dont know what to say or how to start all of this I've told you a countless times I have a hard time expressing my feelings fully and well for this case the love i hold for you is so complexed and big i cant begin explain how much affection ive hold for you and even if i try it will bring no justice to the raw affection and i dont want that i want you to know each fiber each atom of how much i love you baby and be reminded of that everyday i know im tough to be with and sometimes maybe all the time im stubborn to you and it gets tiring sometimes but i hope you dont get tired of me and if you do just tell me and i'll give you the rest that you need i've never loved anyone this long before and its a rollercoaster ride i thought people who last for years are just doing it for media or something tsk i thought 

I want you to know I'll always be there for you and if ever the time comes (which will never come) where i wont be there to be with you or i wont be the person who gets the perviliged to love you and take care of you. you'll always have a space in my heart and that will never go away people have always had this constant fear of being forgotten after death but you have nothing to worry about you'll always be a part of my memories no matter how old i'll get and you'll always be remembred as the girl i loved
